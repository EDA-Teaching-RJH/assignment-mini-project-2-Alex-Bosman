planned features (may change over time):

assemble code
comments
line breaks for each instruction
indentation
assembler definitions - what version of isa am i using
labels - very high priority
macros - user define and load in with a header file???
header files???
where to start the code from - line number?
constants
variables
.word, value (convert 2s compliment)
procedures/functions
gui?
dissassembler?? - only if I have time
I/O devices for cpu? - only if i have time

[label] [opcode] [operand1] [operand2] [operand3] [comments]

instruction mnemonic
literal (a constant number - will need to be checked if it can fit)
label
register


definition for instruction mnemonic (begin, end, definition) - include in an import file



1st run:
remove whitespaces
remove leading and trailing spaces
remove comments
casefold everything

2nd run:
create reserved words table
create symbols table (symbol, symboltype)
types can be constant, variable, label or definition


preprocess stuff (whitespaces, comments etc)

lexical analysis
turn assembly into a stream of tokens (tokentype, tokenvalue)
create symbol table (variables, constants, arrays etc)
reserved word table

syntax analysis
check all tokens to see if they match the syntax

semantic analysis
check operations etc, e.g. not loading a variable as an immediate etc.

code generation


1st regex attempt at matching maf (register or word, (but not special characters))
^\t+([mM][aA][fF]) (\bx[0-9a-fA-F]\b|\b(?!(?:hello|bob))\w+)

2nd attempt (will match ONLY required syntax)
^\t+([mM][aA][fF]) (\bx[0-9a-fA-F]\b|\b(?!(?:hello|bob))\w+)$

3rd attempt
assumes preprocessing will strip all leading and trailing whitespace and comments
^([mM][aA][fF]) (\bx[0-9a-fA-F]\b|\b(?!(?:hello|bob))\w+)$

4th attempt
preprocessor should also casefold everything - also simplifies regex
^(maf) (\br[0-9a-f]\b|(?!(?:\bmaf\b|\bmfa\b|\bmif\b|\bmfr\b|\bmrf\b))\w+)$

5th attempt
can remove the exlusion of reserved words as next stage will throw an error anyway if this is incorrect.
^(maf) (\br[0-9a-f]\b|\w+)$
